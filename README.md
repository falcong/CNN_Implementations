Tensorflow implementation of various generative models based on CNNs. 

These works are absolutely not an effort to reproduce exact results of the cited papers, nor I confine my implementations to the suggestions of the original authors. I have tried to implement my own limited understanding of the original paper in hope to get a better insight into their work.
