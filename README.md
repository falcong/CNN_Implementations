Tensorflow implementation of various generative models based on CNNs. 

This work is absolutely not an effort to reproduce exact results of the cited paper, nor I confine my Implementations to the suggestion of the original authors. I have tried to Implement my own limited understanding of the original paper in hope to get a better insight into their work.
